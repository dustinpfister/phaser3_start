# Phaser 3 - Start

This is what I have togeather for a Phaser 3 Game starting point for a top down style game that makes heavy use of tilemaps. The goal here is to work out a lot of the basic things that will come up when dealing with tilemaps in a game that might have a somewhat large world in which to explore. However sense this is very much a start point I will shy away from writing any game specfic logic.


## What to get done still

```
* ( done ) Use CSV over hard coded data for map
* ( done ) go with 16 by 16 for sprite sheets
* ( done ) display debug info relative to player
* ( done ) boot, and world scene
* ( done ) Load State
* ( done ) spwan locations in maps using map json data files
* (      ) 
```
