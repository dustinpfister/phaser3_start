# Phaser 3 - Start

This is what I have together for a Phaser 3 Game starting point for a top down style game that makes heavy use of tile maps. The goal here is to work out a lot of the basic things that will come up when dealing with tile maps in a game that might have a somewhat large world in which to explore. However sense this is very much a start point I will shy away from writing any game specific logic.


## What to get done still

```
* ( done ) Use CSV over hard coded data for map
* ( done ) Go with 16 by 16 for sprite sheets
* ( done ) display debug info relative to player
* ( done ) boot, and world scene
* ( done ) Load State
* ( done ) Spawn locations in maps using map JSON data files
* ( done ) Have more than one map, and switch between them when entering doors
* ( done ) Have player show up in spawn locations when starting at a new map
* ( done ) Have player go to corresponding door location in new map when entering a door.
* ( done ) Have a player sheet
* ( done ) figure out a 'door slide' solution to help with single doors
* ( done ) Expand hall map and start a Mega-R map
* ( done ) Finish work on 'door slide feature'
* ( done ) Pull door slide feature into its own function
* ( done ) See about having a single door loop
* ( done ) See about fixing problem with door slide feature when moving left
* ( done ) Start a states folder
* ( done ) Have a Load state
* ( done ) Have a World state
* ( done ) see about having objects that take up two slots and have the player be able to go under one of them

* (      ) use point and click to move player
* (      ) get together a solution for path detection


* (      ) add above sprite layer data to the json data for maps
* (      ) additional tiles for work tables
* (      ) additional tiles for



* (      ) Have additional people in the game

* (      ) Have other people move around

* (      ) Have objects in maps that the player can pick up

* (      ) Get 'door slide' feature to work with 1x1 openings in general
* (      ) See about having a way to enter a door when it is disabled, but the player IS going in the direction to enter
* (      ) figure out a solution for 'double doors'
