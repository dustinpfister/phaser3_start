# Phaser 3 - Start

This is what I have together for a Phaser 3 Game starting point for a top down style game that makes heavy use of tile maps. The goal here is to work out a lot of the basic things that will come up when dealing with tile maps in a game that might have a somewhat large world in which to explore. However sense this is very much a start point I will shy away from writing any game specific logic.
