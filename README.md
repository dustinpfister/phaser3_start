# Phaser 3 - Start

This is what I have together for a Phaser 3 Game starting point for a top down style game that makes heavy use of tile maps. The goal here is to work out a lot of the basic things that will come up when dealing with tile maps in a game that might have a somewhat large world in which to explore. However sense this is very much a start point I will shy away from writing any game specific logic.


## What to get done still

```
* ( done ) Use CSV over hard coded data for map
* ( done ) Go with 16 by 16 for sprite sheets
* ( done ) display debug info relative to player
* ( done ) boot, and world scene
* ( done ) Load State
* ( done ) Spawn locations in maps using map json data files
* ( done ) Have more than one map, and switch between them when entering doors
* ( done ) Have player show up in spawn locations when starting at a new map
* ( done ) Have player go to corespoding door location in new map when entering a door.
* (      ) Expand hall map and start a Mega-R map
* (      ) figure out a solution for 'double doors'
* (      ) figure out a 'door slide' solution to help with single doors

* (      ) Have a player sheet, and walking animations
* (      ) Have objects in maps that the player can pick up
* (      ) Start a states folder
```
