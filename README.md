# Phaser 3 - Start Project One

This is what I have together for a first attempt at a Phaser 3 Game starting point for a top down style game that makes heavy use of tile maps. The goal here is to work out a lot of the basic things that will come up when dealing with tile maps in a game that might have a somewhat large world in which to explore. 

In addition to tile maps I will also want to work out a lot of other first time pitfalls when starting to make a Phaser game. With that said I have also touched base on a lot of other subjects when working on this. This includes working with groups, breaking a game down into many states or scenes, attaching events, using the data manager and so forth.

However sense this is very much a start point I will shy away from writing any game specific logic.

## R0 - Tilemaps, player object, states, basic loader, people

With the very first revision I of course wanted to get much of what has to do with the core idea solid. I also wanted this first revision to still be a good starting point for a full game as well. So I have a lot worked out when it comes to working with maps. I went with a system that involves using CSV files for setting tile index values, and then JSON for everything else that will be used for a given map.

I also have a player object that can be moved with the arrow keys, and also with the mouse by clicking on tiles in the current map. Also I got around to adding other people in the game as well, a basic loading screen, and much more.

## R1 - ??

For now I do not have any plans for R1 as I am working on my first game that is based off of what I have started here. However as I work more on that I might get around to working more on this starting point, or make a new one.
